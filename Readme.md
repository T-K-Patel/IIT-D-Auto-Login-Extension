# IIT-D Auto Login Extension

Welcome to the IIT-D Auto Login Extension! This Chrome extension is designed to simplify and automate the login process for various IIT-Delhi portals.

With just a simple alert asking for your permission, the extension takes care of the rest, ensuring you're logged in swiftly and securely.

## Key Features

- **Secure Credential Storage**: Your login details are stored securely on your local machine, ensuring they are accessible only to you and the extension.
- **Automatic Login**: Once permission is granted via a pop-up alert, the extension automatically fills in your login credentials, saving you time and effort.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed with simplicity in mind, making the login process hassle-free for all IIT-D portals.

# Getting Started

To get started with the IIT-D Auto Login Extension, follow these steps to download it directly from this GitHub repository:

1. **Download the Extension**: Click the green **Code** button located at the top of this page, then select **Download ZIP** from the dropdown menu.

## Configure Encryption Settings

For security, set your unique encryption password and salt in the `extScript.js` and `script.js` files.

### Quick Steps:

1. **Edit `extScript.js`**: Open `extScript.js`, and replace the placeholder values in the following lines (around lines 64 and 65) with your own unique entries:
   ```javascript
   const password = "create_your_own_password";
   const salt = "create_your_own_salt";
   ```
2. **Edit `script.js`**: Open `script.js`, and replace the placeholder values in the following lines (around lines 53 and 54) with your own unique entries:
   ```javascript
   const password = "create_your_own_password";
   const salt = "create_your_own_salt";
   ```

### Note:

Both files should have same **password** and **salt**.
Ensure your password and salt are unique and kept secure. Save the changes in both files to complete the setup.
